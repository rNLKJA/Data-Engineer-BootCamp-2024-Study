Docker is a platform for developing, shipping and running applications using containerisation. It allows you to package your application and its dependencies into a standardised Docker container unit. Docker containers are lightweight, portable, and isolated, making running applications consistently across different environments easy.

Kubernetes (k8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates containerised applications' deployment, scaling, and management. It provides features for deploying, maintaining, and scaling application containers across clusters of hosts, making it easier to manage large, complex applications.

Orchestration tools like Kubernetes help manage and automate application container deployment, scaling, and operation. They provide features for load balancing, service discovery, and rolling updates. Popular orchestration tools include Docker Swarm, Apache Mesos, and Amazon ECS.

Some commonly used Docker commands include:

- `docker run`: To run a container from an image.
- `docker build`: To build an image from a Dockerfile.
- `docker ps`: To list running containers.
- `docker exec`: To run a command inside a running container.
- `docker stop`: To stop a running container.
